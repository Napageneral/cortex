And it has total historic knowledge of my chat history across all of my contacts.\n\nI want to develop a feature on top of this context that for every single incoming message, I take some set of context that I know, maybe the last day or 30 days of conversation + some condensed summary of the chat history, and then based on the current conversation offer some suggested prompts/actions for the user to go deeper.\n\nSo like, if me and my girlfriend are wondering where we should go to dinner, I want it to maybe suggest a prompt/action to review places we've talked about going to dinner in the past, then if that action is clicked it will kick off a different agent that will go and execute that.\n\nHowever, the followup action for the agent is outside of scope right now. I only care about reacting to the current conversation + some other context and coming up with 1-3 suggested actions based on that.\n\nWhat context would you include to get good results here?\nHow would you think about this?",

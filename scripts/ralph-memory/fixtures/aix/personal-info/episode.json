      "content": "In October 2025, Thomas S. Prendergast (DOB: 05/22/1972, of 117 S. Fairview Ave, Bayport, NY 11705, phone: 516-617-2280, email: prendergastdev@gmail.com) induced William T. Adams to wire $100,000 to fund what Prendergast described as an \"Indonesian real estate deal\" that would return $2,000,000 within one week. Adams trusted Prendergast based on a prior business relationship.\n\nOn October 21 and 22, 2025, Adams wired two payments of $50,000 each from Capital One (Riverhead, NY) to a JPMorgan Chase account in the name of \"Lauren Taylor\" (Account #929295298). Federal reference numbers: 20251021MMQFMPGH003182 and 20251022MMQFMPGH002953.\n\nThe promised return never materialized. Over the following two months, Prendergast repeatedly delayed with shifting excuses—first claiming the funds were \"tied up\" due to international banking issues, then promising payment \"next week\" during recorded phone calls on December 21 and 26, 2025. In these calls, Prendergast explicitly acknowledged the debt and the $2,000,000 promise but has made no repayment.\n\nThis appears to be an advance-fee fraud scheme. Evidence supporting fraudulent intent includes:\n1. FINANCIAL DISTRESS: Prendergast filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in December 2025 (Eastern District of NY, Case #8-24-75392-las), which was dismissed for failure to file required documents. His primary residence at 117 S. Fairview Ave is in active foreclosure.\n2. PATTERN OF FRAUD: Prendergast is a defendant in Nassau County Supreme Court case 607130/2022 (Stuart Morgen v. Thomas Prendergast), where plaintiff alleges fraud involving $640,000+ in unpaid obligations.\n3. RECIPIENT IDENTITY QUESTIONS: The wire recipient \"Lauren Taylor\" may be associated with Prendergast's residence address per public records.\n4. RECORDED ADMISSIONS: Two phone calls (Dec 21 & Dec 26, 2025) were recorded with Prendergast's knowledge.\n\nAdams, an 80-year-old retiree, has lost his $100,000 with no return and no realistic prospect of voluntary repayment.",

# Cortex Memory System — Progress Log

## Codebase Patterns

*(Add reusable patterns here as you discover them)*

### Project Structure
- `cmd/cortex/` — CLI entry point
- `internal/db/` — Database layer, schema.sql
- `internal/` — Core packages
- `prompts/graphiti/` — LLM prompts for extraction

### Schema Conventions
- Tables use snake_case
- Primary keys are TEXT (UUIDs)
- Timestamps are INTEGER (Unix epoch) or TEXT (ISO 8601)
- JSON fields end with `_json` suffix
- Foreign keys have ON DELETE CASCADE where appropriate

### Go Conventions
- Packages are lowercase, single word when possible
- Structs match table names in PascalCase
- Use context.Context for cancellation
- Errors are returned, not panicked
